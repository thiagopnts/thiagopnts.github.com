## I ‚ù§ Emulators
When I got my first computer it wasn't good enough for most games, but it could run NES(en i es) and Super nintendo emulators in DOS mode, which made possible for me
access a whole number of classics like FFV/VI, breath of fire and others.

Emulators always looked like some sort of black magic created by old wise wizards, this is to demystify that and show we(as web developers) can build our own emulators using tools we use everyday, like HTML, CSS and JS.

I - motivation
II - quick overview on how emulators works(roms, specs, etc) and introducing CHIP-8, a simple interpreted language created decades ago, which is a good start for people trying to learn emulation(you can write an emulator for it with a few lines of code)
III - how all systems specs for CHIP-8 and other emulators can be achieved in the browser(canvas, webaudio api, file api, etc)

Just HTML, CSS and JS. In the end this is more of a motivational talk, despite looking like a very technical thing. By the end of the talk I want people to feel like "hey, I can do that too" because after all you're just using technologies that you're used to.
