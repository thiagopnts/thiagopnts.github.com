title: Why you should give angular a try
---

A few weeks ago I heard about [angular](http://angularjs.org), a JavaScript MVC framework and I decide to read a little about it, when the slogan caught my attention: "What HTML would have been had it been designed for web apps". This is because angular has a different approach compared with other JavaScript MVC frameworks(like [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) and [Spine](http://spinejs.com/)), with angular you can attach angular's attributes to HTML, and they can automatically be accessed through the controller, which is a simple JavaScript function. You can attach a lot of directives(custom attributes for DOM elements), modifying the behavior of the element they are specified in. The cool thing here is the two way data bind, all changes made in the view reflects on the models and all changes on the models reflects in the view, and all this happens like magic. The other thing I liked is because it lets your code more clean and not surrounded by $() everywhere, but if you want, it works great with jQuery. It also has support to REST calls and all that stuff.

Angular still are on a 1.0.0rc version, but I think it's not receiving the attention it's deserves yet, so, if you feel interested, you really should take a look on the angular's site and give it a try!
