title: Hello world and The Passionate Programmer
---

## Hello world!

Since one of my tasks in my internship at OfficeDrop is blog about some books I've been reading, I decided to start it in a new fresh blog, powered by [github pages](http://pages.github.com). There is some work to do here about the layout and stuff, since mine was ~stolen~ from [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman), but I'll do it later, I'm kinda busy right now.

## The Passionate Programmer

So, for this week, I was asked to read "[The Passionate Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Passionate-Programmer-Remarkable-Development/dp/1934356344)". This is a MUST read for any programmer, in this book, Chad Fowler lead us through 53 advices on how to make a remarkable career in software development. After each advice he says what you can do to put it in practice. I'll list some advices I liked below and write about what each one means.

2 - Supply and Demand: On this advice, Chad talks about demand on determined technology and how this affects your job. Simplifying, it's like: if it's paying well Y U NO LEARN IT? There is no space in the market for fanatics, I mean, there is but you'll not give you a chance to evolve.

7 - Be a Generalist: This advice tells that a programmer skills should transcend technology platforms, and not think about this like a "jack-of-all-trades but master of none", you can(and you should) know about the development environment works, how to setup the web server, and all that stuff, because it's all about your job.

8 - Be a Specialist: This is one of my favorite ones, it tells to not use the word specialist as an excuse to limit your knowledge, you can't say you're a Java specialist just because you only know Java, to self titled yourself as a Java specialist you have to know the Java platform deeply, and not only know how to use the standard API.

9 - Don't Pull All Your Eggs in Someone Else's Basket: Don't limit yourself in your goals, Chad tells an interesting history about one of his co-workers which said his career's goal is to be a J2EE Architect, so made a good question, what if the J2EE become obsolete? It's the end of your career? Don't build your career around an specific technology.

15 - Practice, Practice, Practice: Your programming skills grows as much as you practice it. But it's not just doing always the same thing or solving the same problems, you have to practice at your limits, try harder problems, implement harder things. You can take it to know more about your programming language of choice, know about the streams and networking libraries available, etc. It's a win, win.

30 - Say "No": The idea is simple: Just say NO, when you can't do something or when the deadline is too short, it's better then say yes and don't do the work, as he says "Saying yes to avoid disappointment is just lying."

52 - Better Than Yesterday: Just ask yourself everyday: "What can I do today to be better then yesterday?". The awesome thing here is that it's apply about everything in your life.

So, this is it for the first post.
