title: Summary of Domain Driven Design - Applying Analysis Patterns
---

All terms and patterns described in this books requires a lot of experience, and you will keep getting better through time. After some time you will start to look at domain problems and see a familiar sort of responsability or a familiar web of relationships and you can see how this problem was solved before, what models were needed, and figure out the best approach. This looks like some kind of trial and error patterns where you can keep documenting and shareing this with your team for future use. As Martin Fowler says in his _Analysis Patterns: Reusable Object Models_:

>Analysis patterns are groups of concepts that represent a common construction in business modeling. It may be relevant to only one domain or it may span many domains.

This analysis patterns Fowler presents are the ones that comes with a lot of experience in the field, it comes like a starting point for some problems, at least. They are not technological solutions, they come as guides to help ypu work out a model in a particular domain.

In a mature project, the decisions about the project are often made after some experience about the domain, and this comes after a lot of experimentation. The principle and application of analysis patterns can be explained better by example than through abstract description. 

##Analysis Patterns are Knowledge to Draw On

These patterns doesn't give you full solutions, it oftens stimulates your development, and the changes and results comes from insights coming from the analysis. In the middle of this changes there is one kind  you should avoid, it's when you use a term from a well known analysis pattern, you should keep the basic concept intact, however much superficial it might be, and when you introduces this to your language this can take a new whole ubiquitous concept to your domain and this "hide thing" should be avoided.
