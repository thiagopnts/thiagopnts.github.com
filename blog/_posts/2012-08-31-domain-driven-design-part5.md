title: Summary of Domain Driven Design - Breakthrough
---


This is a tiny chapter that says when you should do a "breakthrough" your models, which is the way to go after some refactoring. Slowly but surely, the team assimilates knowledge and this knowledge goes to a model. Deep models can emerge gradually through a sequence of small refactorings, so this breakthrough thing isn't a technique, it's an event. The challenge here is recognize what is happening and decide how to deal with it.

When you decide that you have to do a breakthrough in a model you have to keep in mind that it is more risk than most of the refactoring, the transition to a really deep model is a profound shift in your thinking and demands a major change to the design.
